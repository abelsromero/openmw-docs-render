:openmw-github: https://github.com/OpenMW/

== Image description

This Docker images provides:

* Python 3.6 (on Alpine 3.4)
* Python packages:
** Breathe (https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe)
** parse_cmake (https://github.com/wjwwood/parse_cmake)
* Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)

== How to use it

. Fork/clone the OpenMW repo link:
{openmw-github}[]

. Start an interactive (`-it`) non-persisted (`--rm`) container

 docker run -it --rm -v <openmw directory>:/docs openmw-docs-render
+
This will map the openmw directory to `/docs_` in the container.

. Run the render command from the container shell:

 sphinx-build -b html source build
+
All generated files will be located in `/openmw/docs/build`.
These are already added to `.gitignore`.
